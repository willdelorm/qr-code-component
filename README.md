## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I focused on making this card component easily reusable. Instead of using element selectors, I gave everything a class name that can be easily transferred between projects.

I organized typography and colors into dedicated classes and variables. Taking a page out of frameworks like Tailwind, this allows easy updates in the future without needing to comb through the full project for every instance of a color/font.

### Continued development

For such a simple project, it can be easy to fall back on using a series of `div` elements. I attempted to use more semantic HTML tags, but I would like to keep working on incorporating them in future projects. This will improve both my own organizational practices and readibility for screen readers.
